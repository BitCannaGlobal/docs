#### &#x20;Transfer of Your Personal Data

We take all reasonably possible steps to ensure that Your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to another organization or another country unless there are adequate controls in place for private and secure handling of Your Personal Data.

&#x20;The Usage Data and Communication Data are stored on servers that are located in the EEA. These servers are hosted by EU companies. However: please note that these EU companies have parent companies in the USA.

The USA have certain provisions in law that afford their investigative authorities a right to access data that is processed by USA-based companies or their subsidiaries, even if such data is processed outside the USA. One such provision is Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA", Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that regulates foreign intelligence and counterintelligence of the United States). Another relevant provision is the so-called "Cloud Act" (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act), which applies specifically to USA-based companies in the telecommunications sector and "remote computing services" (which includes cloud hosting providers).

Following [**the adequacy decision taken by the European Commission in July 2023**](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\_23\_3721) it is allowed to use Google Analytics in combination with meeting the requirements set forth by the GDPR.

If You find it important to take 0% chance that Your encrypted Usage Data might be accessed by USA government agencies, we must advise You to not use Our Service.

#### &#x20;Your rights regarding Your Personal Data

You have the right to ask us for an overview of the Personal Data that we process about You (“right of access”). Please note that the Usage Data that we process is only subject to data protection rules because this data could theoretically be traced back to individuals, if we were to combine it with additional information gathered elsewhere. In our normal course of business, we do not actually do this, so we generally cannot trace Usage Data back to You. If You use Your right of access, we will show You the Personal Data that we can connect to You without actively gathering additional information.\
\
For Personal Data that we process on the basis of Your consent, You have the right to withdraw Your consent at any time. Withdrawing Your consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on Your consent before its withdrawal.\
\
For Personal Data that we process on the basis of a legitimate interest, You have the right to object on grounds relating to Your particular situation.\
\
We do our solid best to only process Personal Data that is correct, and only when it is necessary and lawful. Should it ever turn out that Personal Data we process about You is incorrect or unlawful for us to process, then You have the right to have Your Personal Data rectified or erased, or have its processing restricted.\
\
You can invoke any of these rights by sending us an email through: [https://www.bitcanna.io/contact/](https://www.bitcanna.io/contact/)\
\
Please note that we may have to ask You certain control questions or request that You provide identification, when You invoke a right regarding Personal Data. We have to be able to authenticate You as the data subject.\
\
If You are unhappy with the way we are processing Your Personal Data or the way we handled a request to exercise Your rights, please tell us, so we can try to resolve the issue. If we are unable to resolve it, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en)

#### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

_Law enforcement_

Under certain circumstances, We may be required to disclose Your Personal Data to third parties. For example: if we are required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

&#x20;_Other legal requirements_

We may disclose Personal Data to third parties in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

* Comply with a legal obligation
* Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
* Defend or exercise the rights or property of Ourselves, Our employees, Users of the Service  or members of the public
* Protect the personal safety of Our employees, Users of the Service or members of the public
* Assess issues of legal liability and/or defend against claims
* Assess and ensure the security of our business information, including Personal Data

#### Security

The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### Links to Other Websites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

We will let You know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the “Last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
