# Validator Setup Guide

### Hardware Requirements

Here are the minimal hardware configs required for running a validator/sentry node:

* 8GB RAM
* 4vCPUs (8vCPUs is recommened)
* 200GB - 300GB SSD Disk space per year (NVMe disks are recommended)
* 400 Mbit/s bandwith

> Please avoid cheap VPS providers for your main validator. We advise to use a shared dedicated server or a high-end NVMe VPS.
